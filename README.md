# Machine-Learning-Project
üçΩÔ∏è Machine Learning Mini Project ‚Äì Food Image & Diet Classification
MSc Big Data Science | Queen Mary University of London

This two-stage project involved applying machine learning techniques to the MLEND Yummy Dataset (3,250 food samples), progressing from a binary image classification task to a more complex multiclass dietary prediction challenge.

üß™ Part 1 ‚Äì Rice vs Chips Image Classification (Binary)
Objective: Predict whether an image contains a dish with rice (1) or chips (0)

Approach:

Filtered and cleaned the image dataset

Resized all images to 150√ó150 pixels for uniformity

Performed feature extraction and normalisation

Built and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Compared performance using accuracy and confusion matrices

Outcome: Achieved solid classification performance and developed a complete image-based ML pipeline from scratch

üå± Part 2 ‚Äì Dietary Category Prediction (Multiclass)
Objective: Predict the diet type of each dish ‚Äî vegan, vegetarian, or non-vegetarian

Approach:

Cleaned and prepared the structured dataset

Handled categorical variables with one-hot encoding and label encoding

Split the dataset for training and testing

Trained various models and evaluated their accuracy in predicting dietary classes

Outcome: Successfully tackled a multiclass classification problem, enhancing skills in data transformation, model comparison, and encoding strategies

üîß Technologies & Tools:
Python, pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Image processing (PIL, OpenCV)

This project reflects my ability to manage end-to-end ML pipelines across both visual and structured data ‚Äî demonstrating practical skills in feature engineering, model development, and evaluation for both binary and multiclass problems.
